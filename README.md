Hello guys 

Little project i made with a theme generated by 
https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/
the theme was DontStopMoving!

This is my first time using cmake to ship / publish a project on githut so it may not be as well step up as some of you developers out there :).

To build this project run cmake inside the DontStopMoving folder.

Open the Visual Studio Project, things you need todo 
    Set the Project FasterQuicker as the startup project.
    Select show all files open DontStopMoving -- Src -- then open Controller, Render, Sound & Math. Shift select all files and include then in the project this will be class .cpp & .h files.
    Build the project.
    Copy the DLL files from the Deps folder and paste them into where the executable is located.
    Try runnning the project.



Enjoy!
