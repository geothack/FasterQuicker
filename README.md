Hello guys 

Little project i made with a theme generated by 
https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/
the theme was DontStopMoving!

This is my first time using cmake to ship / publish a project on githut so it may not be as well step up as some of you developers out there :).

To build this project run cmake inside the DontStopMoving.
